# ProcessMarks

### Analysis

The program is intended to copy an array of marks from a provided Marks class, without modifying the original file, and then perform certain processing on this array. The program is required to be able to find the maximum, minimum, range, mean, median and mode of marks and to display these exclusively. The program will then assign grades to each mark, build an array with these marks and finally display a distribution of grades.
